Research answers WHAT to build but not HOW:
- Missing Gemini API format/auth details
- No concrete multi-account config design
- No integration analysis with existing routing
- Vague effort estimates depend on unknowns
- Unsubstantiated "high value" claims

Research at 30% complete. Needs technical deep dive + concrete examples before implementation can start.
