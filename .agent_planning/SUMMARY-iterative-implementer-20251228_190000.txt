Completed: Backend routing API endpoints | Files: 3 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (no eval cache for this feature)
Status: complete (backend), frontend TODO

=== COMPLETED WORK ===

Backend API Endpoints (Phase 4.1):
- GET /api/v2/routing/config - Routing configuration with circuit breaker settings
- GET /api/v2/routing/providers - Real-time provider health and circuit breaker state
- GET /api/v2/routing/stats - Routing statistics with fallback events

Files Modified:
- proxy/cmd/proxy/main.go - Added 3 new routing API routes
- proxy/internal/handler/handlers_v2.go - Added 3 new handler methods
- .agent_planning/integrate-archgw/PHASE-4.1-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md - Frontend implementation guide

Implementation Details:
- Leverages existing modelRouter.GetProviderHealth() for circuit breaker state
- Integrates with existing provider stats infrastructure
- Uses existing utility functions (writeJSONResponse, writeErrorResponse)
- Backend compiles successfully with no errors

=== FRONTEND TODO ===

Frontend implementation documented in PHASE-4.1-IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.md:
- routes/routing.tsx - Main routing page
- components/ProviderStatusCard.tsx - Provider status display
- components/RoutingMetricsChart.tsx - Metrics visualization
- lib/api/routing.ts - API client functions

Next Steps:
1. Implement frontend files from implementation notes
2. Test endpoints manually with curl
3. Add navigation link to routing page
4. Test end-to-end functionality
5. Consider adding UPDATE functionality (PUT endpoints) in future

=== TESTING ===

Backend:
✓ Compiles successfully (go build ./cmd/proxy)
✓ Routes registered correctly
✓ Uses existing patterns and infrastructure

Manual Testing Commands:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v2/routing/config
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v2/routing/providers
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v2/routing/stats

=== COMMITS ===

49e16e5 feat(routing-api): add Phase 4.1 backend routing configuration endpoints

=== STATUS ===

Backend: COMPLETE
Frontend: DOCUMENTED (ready for implementation)
Ready for evaluation: YES (backend portion)
