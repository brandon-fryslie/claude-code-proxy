Phase 0.1 Complete - Ready for Phase 0.2 (Design)

Work Completed:
1. Researched ArchGW/Plano architecture and capabilities
2. Installed Plano CLI (planoai v0.4.0) using uv
3. Documented 11+ supported providers with API key requirements
4. Created working plano_config.yaml with 5 providers
5. Documented routing modes and configuration patterns
6. Defined integration architecture for claude-code-proxy
7. Created comprehensive RESEARCH-archgw.md (800+ lines)

Key Findings:
- ArchGW renamed to Plano (https://planoai.dev)
- Rust/Envoy-based proxy, accepts OpenAI format
- Supports OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, Qwen, +5 more
- Intelligent routing via Arch-Router 1.5B model
- Guardrails available (jailbreak, moderation, PII)
- Easy Docker deployment via planoai CLI

Next Steps:
- Phase 0.2: Design ArchGW Provider Integration
  - Create architecture diagram
  - Define ArchGWProvider interface
  - Design config schema
  - Document format conversion strategy
  - Specify error handling approach

Files Modified:
- .agent_planning/integrate-archgw/RESEARCH-archgw.md (new)
