Status: complete

Summary:
The conversation search API endpoint was reported as broken, but investigation revealed
it was actually working correctly. The issue was likely a stale build or process.

However, the error logging was inadequate - it only showed a generic error message
without any context about what query failed or why.

Changes made:
1. Added detailed request logging showing query parameters before search
2. Added success logging showing result count after search  
3. Enhanced error logging to include query and project path for debugging
4. Tested with real search query ("test") - confirmed 1269 results returned

The endpoint now provides clear visibility into:
- What search was attempted (query="X", project="Y", limit=Z, offset=W)
- Whether it succeeded (found N results, total: M)
- If it failed, what query caused the failure

Tests:
- all Go tests pass (go test -tags "fts5" ./...)
- Manual test confirmed search works and logging is helpful
- Build successful with FTS5 tags enabled
