# User Response: Unified Conversation Search

**Response:** REJECTED
**Date:** 2026-01-12

## Reason for Rejection

User wants to take a different architectural direction:
- Convert the repository into a **monorepo**
- Create a new project: **cc-viz** - dedicated to visualizing Claude data
- Decouple visualization from the proxy itself

## Next Steps

New planning needed for:
1. Monorepo structure setup
2. cc-viz project architecture
3. Data flow between proxy and visualization tool

## Files Created (now obsolete)
- `PLAN-20260112.md`
- `DOD-20260112.md`
- `CONTEXT-20260112.md`
