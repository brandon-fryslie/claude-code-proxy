Scope: topic/integrate-archgw
Status: PROPOSED (No implementation)
Verdict: PAUSE - Ambiguities need clarification

Key Findings:
- ArchGW renamed to Plano (Rust/Envoy, not Go)
- Current Go proxy has working routing: 984 lines, 2 providers, subagent support
- Plano offers: 11+ providers, preference routing, guardrails, observability
- API mismatch: Plano requires OpenAI format, proxy receives Anthropic

Integration Options:
A. Full Replacement - HIGH risk, lose monitoring/dashboard
B. Upstream Integration - MEDIUM risk, added latency
C. Feature Porting - VARIABLE risk, cherry-pick features

Ambiguities (must resolve):
1. Primary goal? (Providers / Routing / Guardrails / Observability)
2. Docker acceptable? Current deploy is single Go binary
3. Anthropic format passthrough important?
4. Integration scope? (Replace vs integrate vs port)

Recommendations:
- Proceed with vibeproxy features first (lower risk)
- Define success criteria before ArchGW work
- Wait on web-routing-configuration until ArchGW decision

Cache: No new eval-cache entries (research phase)
-> PAUSE: Clarify integration goals before proceeding
