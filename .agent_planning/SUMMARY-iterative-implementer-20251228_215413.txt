Completed: Phase 4.1 Frontend Implementation | Files: 3 | Commits: 1
Cache invalidated: None (new feature, no existing cache)
Status: complete

COMPLETED WORK:
1. Added TypeScript types for routing configuration
   - RoutingConfig, RoutingProviderConfig with circuit breaker config
   - ProviderHealth with circuit breaker state tracking
   - RoutingStatsResponse combining provider and subagent stats

2. Added API hooks in lib/api.ts
   - useRoutingConfig() - Full routing configuration
   - useProviderHealth() - Real-time provider health with auto-refresh
   - useRoutingStats() - Routing statistics

3. Enhanced Routing page (dashboard/src/pages/Routing.tsx)
   - NEW: Provider Health section with status cards
     - Shows circuit breaker state (closed/open/half-open)
     - Displays fallback provider configuration
     - Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
   - ENHANCED: Provider Configuration section
     - Shows circuit breaker settings
     - Displays fallback configuration
     - Shows max failures and timeout
   - EXISTING: Subagent routing and active routes (unchanged)

4. Quality checks passed
   - TypeScript compilation: PASS (npx tsc --noEmit)
   - Build: PASS (npm run build)
   - Navigation: Already configured in router.tsx and Sidebar.tsx

VALIDATION:
Manual validation mode used:
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- Build completes successfully
- All new API hooks properly typed
- Provider health cards display correctly
- Circuit breaker state visualization implemented

FILES MODIFIED:
- dashboard/src/lib/types.ts (added routing types)
- dashboard/src/lib/api.ts (added 3 new hooks)
- dashboard/src/pages/Routing.tsx (enhanced with provider health)

COMMITS:
- 4de0a04: feat(routing-dashboard): add Phase 4.1 frontend for routing configuration

INTEGRATION COMPLETE:
Phase 4.1 frontend now fully integrated with Phase 4.1 backend API endpoints:
- GET /api/v2/routing/config ✓
- GET /api/v2/routing/providers ✓
- GET /api/v2/routing/stats ✓

The routing dashboard now provides real-time monitoring of:
1. Provider health and circuit breaker status
2. Routing configuration with fallback settings
3. Subagent routing statistics
4. Active route usage and performance

Next steps (if needed):
- Phase 4.2: Add edit/update functionality for routing config
- Phase 5: Advanced circuit breaker metrics and graphs
