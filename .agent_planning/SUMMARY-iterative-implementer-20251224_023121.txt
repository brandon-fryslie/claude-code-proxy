Cache invalidated: N/A (no eval cache present)
Status: complete

WORK COMPLETED:
================

1. Created TypeScript type definitions (src/lib/types.ts)
   - Mapped all Go model types from proxy/internal/model/models.go
   - Comprehensive types for requests, stats, conversations, and analytics

2. Implemented API client with TanStack Query hooks (src/lib/api.ts)
   - useRequestsSummary, useRequestDetail
   - useHourlyStats, useWeeklyStats, useModelStats
   - useProviderStats, useSubagentStats, useToolStats, usePerformanceStats
   - useConversations, useConversationDetail
   - Utility functions: getTodayDateRange, formatDuration, formatTokens

3. Updated vite.config.ts
   - Changed proxy target from port 3000 to 3001 (matches proxy server)

4. Wired up Dashboard page (src/pages/Dashboard.tsx)
   - Real-time stats: today's requests, tokens used, avg response time, active providers
   - Recharts visualizations: hourly request volume bar chart, token usage by provider pie chart
   - Proper loading states and empty state handling

5. Wired up Requests page (src/pages/Requests.tsx)
   - Request summaries list with virtualization-ready structure
   - Lazy-loaded request details on click
   - Search functionality
   - Full request/response body display

6. Wired up Performance page (src/pages/Performance.tsx)
   - Performance metrics: avg, p50, p95, p99 response times
   - Multi-series bar chart comparing percentiles by provider/model
   - Detailed statistics table with TTFB data

7. Wired up Routing page (src/pages/Routing.tsx)
   - Subagent routing configuration display
   - Routing statistics: total routed, total tokens, avg latency
   - Detailed token usage breakdown by subagent

8. Wired up Usage page (src/pages/Usage.tsx)
   - Token usage summaries: today, this week, this month
   - Token usage by model bar chart
   - Weekly trend chart (last 7 days)
   - Detailed breakdown table

9. Wired up Conversations page (src/pages/Conversations.tsx)
   - Conversation list with project names and metadata
   - Conversation detail view showing message turns
   - Proper master-detail layout

VALIDATION:
============

Manual validation performed:
- TypeScript compilation: PASSED (pnpm build successful)
- Build output: 736.41 KB bundle (production ready)
- No TypeScript errors
- All pages compile without warnings

NEXT STEPS:
============

To test the dashboard:
1. Start the proxy server: cd proxy && go run cmd/proxy/main.go
2. Start the dashboard: cd dashboard && pnpm dev
3. Open http://localhost:5174
4. Make some API requests through the proxy to populate data
5. Verify all pages load and display real data correctly

The dashboard is now fully wired up to the backend APIs and ready for testing with live data.
