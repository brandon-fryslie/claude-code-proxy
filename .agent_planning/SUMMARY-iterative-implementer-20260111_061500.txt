Status: complete

Summary:
--------
Successfully fixed all failing Playwright e2e tests to achieve 100% pass rate (33/33 tests).

Changes Made:
1. Updated helpers.ts - replaced networkidle with domcontentloaded, added JSDoc
2. Fixed 6 test files - replaced networkidle in all e2e test files
3. Added aria-label to Sidebar collapse button - fixed accessibility test
4. Updated TESTING.md - documented patterns and troubleshooting

Root Causes Fixed:
- networkidle timeouts: Dev environment has persistent network activity (Vite HMR, React Query)
- Missing aria-label: Sidebar collapse button lacked accessibility label

Test Execution Time: ~12-15 seconds (down from 30s+ timeouts)

Validation:
- All 33 tests pass consistently (verified 3 consecutive runs)
- ESLint passes for all changed e2e files
- Test execution time meets <2 minute goal
